                    <p>
                        a.) Devcenter, a Devcenter Inc. product (“Devcenter” or “we”), provides its Service (as defined below) to you 
                        through its web site located at devcenter.co (the “Site”), subject to this Terms of Service agreement (“TOS”). 
                        By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service or Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, 
                        and agree to be bound by this TOS. If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company, business or other legal 
                        entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to this TOS, in which case 
                        the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you 
                        do not agree with this TOS, you must not accept this TOS and may not use the Service.
                    </p>

                        b.) Devcenter may change this TOS from time to time by providing thirty (30) days prior notice either by emailing the 
                        email address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Site. You can review the most current version 
                        of this TOS at any time via devcenter.co. The revised terms and conditions will become effective thirty (30) days after 
                        we post or send you notice of such changes, and if you use the Service after that date, your use will constitute 
                        acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this TOS is not acceptable to you, your only remedy 
                        is stop using the Services.
