          <p class="section-content">For a while now, transportation has been at the top of my mind. I wanted to make the activities of taking transit in Lagos simple and efficient through design. I made an attempt once which I obviously didn't finish.</p>

          </p>

          <p class="section-content">About a year later (well life happened but most importantly, I gained more knowledge and understanding), while I was transitioning into a better product designer changed my perception and idea of how to tackle and solve problems. It then occurred to me that the direction I was taking on this project was not that impressive.</p>

          <p class="section-content">Going back to read what I had written previously made me chuckle a bit. A product/service like this cannot be built on a bad system. It's not just going to work. Where is the bus live service data going to come from? Who is going to put digital road signs for people to find their ways? The government? Lol. The reason why the UK metro system works well is because the government really invested in it to make sure people can move around easily. It would be hard to solve this problem with the government in the picture currently. There are just so many dependencies on the system.</p>

          <p class="section-content">I decided to go back to the drawing board to properly analyze the current system, available resources, and what could be worked out  which meant that I had to rethink the whole experience and execute with a different approach i.e a more workable solution with real business goals which eventually morphed into a different idea.</p>

However, we weren't trying to revert to a simple past. Our ambitions were to create a strong foundation that embraced a rapidly evolving business and more diverse user base.</p>

          <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Make it easy, fast, convenient and affordable to move around Lagos especially going to work and back.</li>
            <li>Give commuters more control over their time.</li>

          <h3 class="sub-title text-dark text-bold">The Commuters</h3>
          <p class="section-content">In the absence of full-time content writers on the team, we had to rely on our lead product managers, engineers, and architects to produce the documentation content. At the end of each sprint, a subsection of content was handed off to content editors, which included everyone in the company, influencers within the SF blockchain community, and leading blockchain developers.</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title text-dark text-bold">The Drivers (People)</h3>
          <p class="section-content">With the majority of our developers focused on System Engineering and building the Dashboard, I took up the task of developing the Documentation interface, in addition to designing the documentation experience on web and mobile. Using HTML and CSS, I first wrote up about ~90% of the code (navigation, page layouts, typography, color scheme, responsiveness), and then solicited the help of our Product Architect and CPO for the more complex programming logic, testing across browsers, and fine-tuning of the visual styles. </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title text-dark text-bold">Environment (The City itself)</h3>
          <p class="section-content">The leadership team believed early on that blockchain is a new type of product, and thus requires completely novel solutions for learning, such as interactive wizards and videos. Although I did research the value of such solutions, I ultimately fell back on the validated effectiveness of high-quality documentation. We didn't pursue the proposed complex solutions, but researching them enabled me to communicate why they weren't the right solution.</p>

The display uses Bluetooth and WiFi to connect to your phone and router. During the connecting phase, things can go very wrong very quickly. Maybe you typed in the wrong SSID. Maybe your display is too far away from the router. Maybe the connection times out. Every case needed to be covered and lend a hand to the customer to walk them through the problem and the solution.</p>

          <p class="section-content" data-aos="fade-up">During the connecting step, when the display attempts to connect to the WiFi network, the phone can't see the connection progress. It's clueless. All we can tell you is that the display is trying to connect, until it times out. However, we can inform you of the error on the display. From this challenge arose a solution: a troubleshooting mode to walk you through error diagnosis. If there is an error, you can match the respective error on the display to their phone. We give you an explanation and next steps to solve the problem. At the end of every path is the option to contact support. There's never a dead end, so we never leave you hanging.</p>

          <p class="section-content" data-aos="fade-up">Playing with established patterns can be taboo. There lies a tension between usability and creativity. Although it bucks conventions, user testing described our nav as "fun" and "delightful," even "elegant," with little learning effort required. Going back to the app's hierarchy, our new navigation sets Home, at the absolute top. Instead of 4 equally weighted tabs, we designed one predominant platform for 3 secondary experiences. And, Home is always a swipe away.</p>

          <p class="section-content" data-aos="fade-up">In retrospect, I realized that despite its success in user testing, and our need for hierarchy, we were solving a problem that didn't really exist. The navigation was cool. But the core problem was the accessibility of display controls and the need of a Now Playing feature, not the navigation. Users are committed to using the app once they purchase an EO, but forcing them to use something entirely new is a little rough. That said, there is always room for innovation. Many apps are exploring unique navigation patterns and EO is a unique product in itself.</p>

          <p class="section-content">When configuring components, users could hover over the property field names and access the definitions. As a result, they didn't need to context-switch to their offline code editor and AWS documentation.</p>

          <h3 class="sub-title text-dark text-bold">The devil is in the details</h3>
          <p class="section-content">Often times, what a user said did not translate to what they actually did. For example, while they expressed a need for preset configurations, they opted to create their cloud setup from scratch because the cost of editing outweighed its benefits. As a result, I learned to use testing and analytics to tell me what users are actually doing, and user interviews & studies to understand why they are doing it.  </p>

          <h3 class="sub-title text-dark text-bold">Good product doesn't mean good business</h3>
          <p class="section-content">Working on pdestal taught me how to build, or rather how not to build an Enterprise product. Through mistakes and failures, we learned how to balance the needs of our users with that of the business and customer, properly filter customization requests from enterprises, and allocate resources for customer support and building partnerships. However, we discovered that the varying needs of enterprises required a high-touch development process that we couldn't financially support for long-term growth. Building a product that solves user problems is one thing, but building a viable business is another problem altogether. </p>
