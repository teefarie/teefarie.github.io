                        Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Devcenter, a Devcenter Inc. product (“Devcenter”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Devcenter and has been created to provide information about our company and our software-as-a-service platform for hiring software developers and managing software development projects, mobile applications and related services (together with the Site, the “Services”) to our Service visitors (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Devcenter’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.Service.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below: Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Devcenter collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Devcenter and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.##Register in the US
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Other information:</strong></p>
                    <p>Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Devcenter through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Devcenter may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Devcenter affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.
                    </p>

                    <p>In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.</p>

                    <p><strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong><br> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Devcenter often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Devcenter may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Devcenter may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Third Party Tracking and Analytics:</strong><br> We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Services. For example, we may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), and Mixpanel, a mobile and web analytics platform provided by Mixpanel, Inc. (“Mixpanel”). Google and Mixpanel use cookies or similar technologies to help us analyze how users function and use our mobile applications and the Site to improve our Service. We may also implement Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising (which may include Remarketing with Google Analytics). Visitors can opt out by using Google’s Ads Settings or going to tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. To opt-out of Mixpanel’s collection of your data, go to mixpanel.com/optout/. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser's cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers) you may also clear the Mixpanel opt-out cookie.</p>

                    <h3 id="our-disclosure">Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
                    <p>   
                        Devcenter is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong><br>
                    As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

                    <p><strong>Related Companies:</strong><br>
                    We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong><br>
                    Devcenter, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong><br>
                    Devcenter may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Devcenter, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>

                    <h3 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h3>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Devcenter other than Personal Data collected through the Services.

This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Devcenter shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>
